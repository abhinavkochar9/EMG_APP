1) **Summary:** Your "Clasp and Spread" exercise shows excellent overall form with an average similarity of 96.93%.  While most repetitions were strong, minor adjustments in a few steps can optimize lymphatic drainage. We'll focus on refining specific phases to maximize your results.

2) **Strengths Observed:** You consistently demonstrated good posture and range of motion throughout the majority of the exercise.  Your breath control is improving, particularly in the later repetitions.  The overall consistency is impressive!

3) **Top Corrections:**

    * **(a) What to fix:** Slight forward head posture during the clasp phase (R1-S1, R2-S1).
    * **(b) Quick cue:** "Imagine a string gently lifting you from the crown of your head."
    * **(c) Why it matters:** Maintaining neutral cervical spine enhances lymphatic drainage from the neck and upper chest region, preventing stagnation.

    * **(a) What to fix:**  Incomplete scapular retraction during the spread phase (R1-S5, R2-S5, R3-S5, R4-S5).
    * **(b) Quick cue:** "Squeeze your shoulder blades together firmly, feeling them slide down your back."
    * **(c) Why it matters:** Full scapular retraction promotes lymphatic drainage in the upper back, reducing congestion around the lymph nodes in that area.

    * **(a) What to fix:**  Holding your breath during transitions (noticeable dips in R1-S2 and R2-S1).
    * **(b) Quick cue:** "Inhale deeply during the clasp, exhale fully during the spread.  Maintain a smooth, consistent breath."
    * **(c) Why it matters:**  Proper breath coordination facilitates diaphragmatic movement, which pumps lymphatic fluid through the body, enhancing overall drainage.


4) **Step-specific notes for each weak step:**  The lowest scores cluster in the initial clasp and final spread phases of the first two repetitions. Focusing on the corrections above—specifically maintaining good posture and complete scapular movement—should improve these scores significantly.


5) **Next Session Plan:**

    * **Target Similarity:** 98% overall.
    * **Focus:**  Maintain perfect posture and full scapular retraction in each rep, paying close attention to breath coordination throughout the exercise.
    * **Target Similarity for specific Steps:** Achieve 95% similarity in all R1-S5 and R2-S5 steps.

6) **Safety Note:** Stop the exercise immediately if you experience any pain and consult your healthcare provider.
