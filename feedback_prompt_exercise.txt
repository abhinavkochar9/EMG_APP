Give supportive, specific, and clinically-informed feedback focused on posture precision, range of motion, scapular control, and pain-free execution. Always be encouraging, but precise. Suggest at most 3 prioritized corrections and 3 simple at-home cues. Provide a short "Next Session Plan" with 2–3 bullet points and a realistic target similarity (+/- tolerance). Avoid medical diagnosis; refer to a clinician if pain persists. === CURRENT SESSION REPORT === File: Report_ClaspAndSpread_2025-08-24_16-18-55.csv Overall Average Similarity: 96.93% Averages by Rep: R1=96.8; R2=95.3; R3=97.8; R4=97.8 Averages by (Rep,Step): R1-S1=94.7; R1-S2=93.1; R1-S3=95.8; R1-S4=98.7; R1-S5=89.4; R2-S1=87.2; R2-S2=91.2; R2-S3=97.0; R2-S4=96.7; R2-S5=93.5; R3-S1=97.6; R3-S2=95.1; R3-S3=97.3; R3-S4=98.9; R3-S5=93.5; R4-S1=97.4;…\n\n[Doc 3 | Deep_Breathing.txt | score=0.052]\nTitle: Deep Breathing Muscle tightening deep breathing stimulates lymphatic ducts and helps lymph fluid drain. It promotes whole-body muscle pumping, which supports lymphatic drainage. It also improves oxygen flow and healing. Instructions: 1. Sit or stand comfortably. 2. Place your hands on your abdomen. 3. Inhale slowly through your nose while tightening your whole body muscles. Visualize fluid moving to your chest. 4. Exhale slowly through your mouth while relaxing your muscles. Visualize pushing fluid out. Repeat 4 times.

Instructions: 1. Sit or stand comfortably. 2. Stretch your arm straight overhead. Feel the resistance. 3. Open your palm and fingers wide. 4. Make a fist while inhaling and tightening your muscles. 5. Open your hand while exhaling and relaxing your muscles. Visualize fluid being pumped out of your affected arm. Repeat 4 times.\n\n[Doc 5 | Shoulder_Rolls.txt | score=0.032]\nTitle: Shoulder Rolls Shoulder rolls help regain shoulder mobility and strength after breast cancer surgery. They support lymphatic flow and proper breathing. Instructions: 1. Sit or stand comfortably. 2. Gently squeeze both shoulder blades back and down in a circular motion. 3. Repeat 4 times. Tip: Inhale deeply when pulling your shoulders back to expand your ribs and improve oxygen flow.\n\n\nWrite feedback with these sections:
